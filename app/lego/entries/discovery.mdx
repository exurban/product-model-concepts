Discovery is the process of using quantitative and qualitative data to gather evidence to support hypotheses of opportunities, solutions to those opportunities, and their impact on business goals.

The product model approach to discovery minimizes waste by clearly identifying and defining opportunities and associated assumptions and risks and thoroughly testing proposed solutions before determining a solution is ready to be built. By testing hypotheses quickly and cheaply before building, product model teams more consistently deliver solutions that advance business goals, reducing time to value. Feature teams who don't take the time to gather evidence and test hypotheses thoroughly may have quicker time to market, but Marty Cagan estimates that 70-90% of features developed in this manner do not result in a positive return on investment.
