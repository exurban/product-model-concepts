Discovery is the activity of generating and evaluating opportunities to broaden and deepen product-market fit. The product model emphasizes time-to-value over time-to-market. The goal is to minimize waste by testing ideas quickly and cheaply. research, testing, and learning before committing to building to minimize waste. The goal is to test ideas quickly and cheaply

Generative Research: Generate insights about the market, customers, and opportunities through customer and stakeholder feedback, interviews, surveys, and competitive analysis. The goal is to generate, assess and stack rank new opportunities to broaden and deepend product-market fit.

## Escaping the Build Trap

React refs are a powerful and versatile feature that empowers developers to break away from the confines of a purely declarative paradigm when necessary. This “escape hatch” allows us to interact with the DOM, integrate with third-party libraries, manage focus and selection, create animations, and facilitate custom component communication without compromising the fundamental principles of React.
While refs can be helpful in specific scenarios, it’s essential to exercise caution and use them sparingly, as overuse can lead to complex and less maintainable code.
