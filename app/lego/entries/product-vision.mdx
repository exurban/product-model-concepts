Once the product has achieved initial PMF and the product team has a solid understanding of their target market and its opportunities, the product team can use these learnings to develop a vision for the product. The product vision:

1. is a compelling, customer-centric description of the future you're trying to create for your users,
2. unites all product teams with the shared goal of making the vision a reality,
3. is a great recruiting tool, and,
4. is the main thrust of the value proposition of a future version of your product.
