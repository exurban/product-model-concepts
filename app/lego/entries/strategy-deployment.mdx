Strategy deployment is the process of translating a company's strategic objectives into a set of actionable initiatives for each time horizon (e.g., short-, medium-, and long-term). Its purpose is to ensure that employee's daily decisions and activities are aligned with the company's long-term strategy.

By deploying the strategy in this way, organizations can ensure that everyone is clear on what needs to be done, by when, and by whom, and can track progress against the strategic objectives over time.
